Please create a more decent design for this app, try to focus for the mobile design first if you can.

Edit the `App.css` in the ***src*** directory if you want to change the stylings.

You can add additional `classNames` for the html element by editing the elements inside the documents in the ***components*** and ***pages*** directory.
